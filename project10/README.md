## Challenges

### Challenge 1

> Our address fields are currently considered valid if they contain anything, even if it’s just only whitespace. Improve the validation to make sure a string of pure whitespace is invalid.

### Challenge 2

> If our call to placeOrder() fails – for example if there is no internet connection – show an informative alert for the user. To test this, just disable WiFi on your Mac so the simulator has no connection either.

### Project 15 - Challenge 1

> The check out view in Cupcake Corner uses an image that doesn’t add anything to the UI, so find a way to make the screenreader not read it out.
